# Actor systems

## Agent-based Programming
a.k.a. [The Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Actor_model)

> ...is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent computation: in response to a message that it receives, an actor can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received.

First proposed in 1973!
